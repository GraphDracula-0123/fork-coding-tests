# Coding Tests

We have created these coding tests as part of interviews for internships to gain insight into the applicants' programming skills.
The repository is updated from time to time and new tasks and solutions might be added.

## Procedure
We have several problems to solve and usually we will tell you which one(s) to solve and how much time you have to do it. There is no strict time limit, but we give you a time frame of a few days (usually 7-10 days) to solve the problems on your own.
Each problem contains a detailed description of the tasks and instructions on how to submit your solution.
In general, we expect you to create a branch for your solution and create a pull request once your done programming.
